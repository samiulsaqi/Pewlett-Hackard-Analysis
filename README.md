- Over 90 thousand employees will be retiring pretty soon;
- Of this 90 thousand, only 14% are in junior staff position, the rest are in senior or technical positions;
- Although this is a bleak picture, there are still around 1500 people who can be considered for part-time positions for mentorship
- Of the people eligible for mentorship, only 15.6% are in junior positions, so it might be a good thing if they accept

# Summary

In summary, Pewlett Hackard will need to fill a lot of positions real quickly, but there are still some wiggle rooms:

- Around 90 thousand (90,328) positions will need to be filled as the silver tsunami hits them and this gets escalating to all the departments
- There is not enough people to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees, as eligible employees for mentorship is just 1.7% of the total retiring community.

Overall, this seems like a really challenging time for Pewlett Hackard, as they need to transfer the accumulated experience and knowledge in a short amount of time. Some additional queries that might help can be:
    -   Retiring percentage of employees by departments; or
    -   Employees that can be promoted based on employment period so that only junior positions need to be filled.
